Calorie Counter


FOR THIS PROJECT, I'VE BUILD A FORM WHICH ALLOWS THE USER TO INPUT CALORIE INTAKE. THE FORM CALCULATES THE INTAKE FROM FOUR MAJOR CATEGORIES: BREAKFAST, LUNCH DINNER, AND SNACKS. THE INPUT SYSTEM ALSO ALLOWS THE USER TO ADD CALORIES BURNED BY EXERCIES AND CALULATES WHETHER THE USER IS AT A CALORIC DEFICIT OR SURPLUS BASED ON THE DAILY CALORIC BUDGET SET BY THE USER.
